# Task 6

# Task 7

vim L \<tab> . \<tab> 

* here I am trying the use the vim command on the file i am trying to edit. L + tab here autofiled "ListExamples" and . + tab autofiled the ".java". So with these two auto fills I was able to type out the file I want to write vim with without typing its full file name.

/ i n d e x 1 <space> + \<enter> n e \<right arrow>  i \<delete> 2 \<esc> : x

* here I am first trying to locate the place where "index1 +" appears by using "/index1 +" . when I press "n" to move muy curser to the second time index1 appears. "e" then move my curser to the end of that world. the right arrow then move it to behind "index1" so that " i \<delete> 2" can first delete the "1" in index1 and replace it with "2". \<esc> : x then exits the vim and saves the edit.
